# My impression

- Providing services directly as message based interfaces removes a lot of service specific app downloads and account creations
- Enables more efficient cross-communication between services, since the chat can bee seen as an API
- Existing technology for natural language input processing
- Could facilitate better inter-service communications (*köh* Semantic web *köh*)
- Prototyping and defining how conversational interactions will work with computers
- Paves way for the real life Jarvis / Samantha (*Her*)

## On the other hand

- Not sure how much text I want to write in order to use a services
  - Speech might solve this
  - Unless you are in public...
- Companies will probably want to brand their services and contents a bit more than a plain chat interface
- Bot responses still seem to be a bit pre-canned
  - The discussion is not really natural
- MS technologies not really production ready
  - Bugs, sign up delays, poor documentation ...
- Feels slightly like a new platform just for competitions sake
  - Microsoft failed the mobile era, tries to be relevant in the next one
- Basically still a command line prompt
  - And still quite a bit slower, not really instant
- Finns have a hard time to ask for things
