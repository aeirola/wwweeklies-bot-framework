# My impression

- Providing services directly as message based interfaces removes a lot of service specific app downloads and account creations
- Enables more efficient cross-communication between services, since the chat can bee seen as an API
- Existing technology for natural language input processing

## On the other hand

- Not sure how much text I want to write in order to use a services
  - Speech might solve this
  - Unless you are in public...
- Companies will probably want to brand their services and contents a bit more than a plain chat interface
- Bot responses still seem to be a bit pre-canned
  - The discussion is not really natural
