# The promise of bots

- Service-specific apps are a waste of time
   - Who want's to install yet one more conference app on their phone?
   - Same goes for service-specific accounts
- Conversations are the new UI paradigm
- Chat apps (Skype, Messenger, Telegram, ...) are the new browsers
- Bots are the new service interfaces
- Digital personal assistants (Siri, Cortana, ...) give added value
   - Can find and contact bots on your behalf
   - And they know your preferences
- Chat is easier than web on mobile, especially with speech input
- Chat becomes the gateway to digital services in the mobile era
- Gives companies a presence on the mobile phone without fighting the platform or app war
