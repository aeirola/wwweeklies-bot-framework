# Microsofts vision

- Service-specific apps are a waste of time
   - Same goes for service-specific accounts
- Conversations is the new UI paradigm
- Chat apps (Skype, Telegram, Slack) are the new browsers
- Bots are the new websites
- Digital personal assistants (Cortana, Siri, Google Now, Alexa) give added value
   - They know your preferences
   - And find and contact bots on your behalf
- Chat is easier on mobile, especially with speech input
- Chat becomes the gateway to digital services in the mobile era
