# Personal take

- Providing services directly as message based interfaces removes a lot of service specific app downloads and account creations
- Also enables more efficient cross-communication between services, since the chat can bee seen as an API
- Not sure how much text I want to write in order to use a services
  - Speech might solve this, unless sitting on the subway...
- Companies will probably want to brand their services and contents a bit more than a plain chat screen
