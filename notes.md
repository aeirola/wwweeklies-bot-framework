  - General
    - Microsoft  chat framework
    - Show off boet from CodeCamp
    - Create new bot as slides for presentation

  - Once big in mobile
  - Struggled to stay relevant
  - Failed miserably
  - No real home-screen app presence
  - Trying to find the next big thing

    - Bots

 - Microsofts vision
  - Bots is the new UI paradigm (according to Microsoft)
  - Chat apps (Skype, telegram, slack) are the new browsers
  - Bots are the new websites
  - Digital personal assistants (Cortana, Siri, Google Now, Alexa) are the added value
    - They can find and contact bots on your behalf
  - Chat is easier on mobile
  - Chat is the gateway to the web in the mobile era

 - Microsofts tech
  - Bot connector, connect your bot to all services (canvases)
  - A bot is a HTTP server that serves requests
    - Web servers
      - Requests are methods, URLs and bodies
      - Responses are HTML pages
    - Bot servers
      - Requests are messages, along with conversation state
      - Response are messages
  - To make your bots more powerful, MS provides cognitive services (https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/)
    - Vision APIs to analyze images
    - Speech APIs to understand spoken words, and generate speech
    - Language APIs to understand natural language
    - Knowledge APIs, like Wolfram Alpha i guess
    - Search APIs
  - Personal take
    - Not sure if one wants to write a lot of text
    - If speech takes off, it might be nice on mobile
    - Would think brands like to show off a bit more
